# BubbleSort
Simple implementation of bubble sort in Golang
This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of ÎŸ(n2) where n is the number of items.


Outputs-----------

 before sorting  [20 35 -15 -16 7 55 1 -22 100 30 509 60 300 2394]
 
 
 after sorting [-22 -16 -15 1 7 20 30 35 55 60 100 300 509 2394]
